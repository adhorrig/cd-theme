Adding media within articles
------------------------

Using POD Admin you need to extend posts and add two new fields, with the following labels and filetypes:
* video (File / video / image)
* video-poster (File / video / image)
* article_desc (Text)

*Video* should accept video file types and be used to host the video directly.
 > Upload both an mp4, and a ogg file.

With the *Video-poster* item you should accept images and this will host the Video's poster (image shown before the video plays).

If neither of this fields are field in a horizontal rule is shown instead to show.

*post_banner* A required image for posts. This image needs to be large and high quality. It will be injected into a carousel on page-news.
